# PikaOS Installer Script

<img src="https://github.com/VictoryTek/VictoryNobara/blob/main/VictoryNobara.png" />

This README contains the steps I do to install and configure a fully-functional PikaOS Linux after installation, containing all my preferred applications and utilities. The shell scripts in this repo allow the entire process to be automated.)

## Create PikaOS ISO

Download PikaOS from https://pika-os.com/#download and put it on a USB drive with Etcher, Ventoy, Rufus or Popsicle.

```
git clone https://github.com/VictoryTek/PikaOS
cd PikaOS
chmod +x setup.sh

./setup.sh

```

A script developed for customizing Arch, then adapted for Fedora, then adapted for Nobara, now adapted for PikaOS.
